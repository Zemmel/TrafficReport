# TrafficReport
Having problems figuring out why traffic is backed up? Want to know why a donut van is in the middle of an industrial district? Maybe this is the tool for you. 

To activate the tools, select the round button in the top left next to the info view button. Your cursor will switch to a magnifying glass. 

The tool has 3 modes depending on the sort of thing you examine. 

1. Selecting a vehicle will show its current path to its destination. 
2. Selecting a stretch of road will show you the paths of all vehicles that are currently on route to pass through it. 
3. Selecting a building will show you all paths of vehicles currently either going to or leaving from it. (Does not show resident/worker locations or commute routes, only active in progress paths) 

Please note this is an early beta and has some funky bugs, particularly with displaying paths. 

We have lots of planned features coming soon so watch this space. 

Planned features roadmap: 

1. Better UI 
2. Ability to separate vehicle types by type and colour them 
3. Options to filter traffic 

Any suggestions, feel free to leave a mesage in the feature request discussion thread.
