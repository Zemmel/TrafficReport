# TrafficReport
Having problems figuring out why traffic is backed up? Want to know why a donut van is in the middle of an industrial district? This maybe the tool for you. 

To activate the tools, select the round button in the top left next to the info view button. Your cursor will switch to a magnifying glass. To cancel this, press the button again or choose another tool. 

The tool has 3 modes depending on the sort of thing you examine. 

1. Selecting a vehicle will show its current path to its destination. 
2. Selecting a stretch of road will show you the paths of all vehicles that will pass through it 
3. Selecting a building will show you all paths of vehicles either going to or leaving from it 

Selecting a road or building will halt the simulation for several seconds (depending on city size). Please be patient you game has not crashed. 

Please note this is an early beta and has some funky bugs, particularly with displaying paths. 

We have lots of planned features coming soon so watch this space. 

Planned features roadmap: 

1. Better UI and path rendering 
2. Ability to separate vehicle types by type and colour them 
3. Options to filter traffic 
4. Support for querying pedestrians 

Any suggestions, feel free to leave a mesage in the feature request discussion thread. 

Known Issues: 

- The chirpy exterminator mod puts a button at the same location, please disable it see the button
